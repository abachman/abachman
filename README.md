## Hello from Baltimore, MD ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior software developer with a particular interest in full-stack web development, distributed systems, creative coding, and teaching. I like building real-time messaging systems and tweaking user interfaces.

Right now I'm playing with [Operational Transforms](https://github.com/abachman/document-editor) and [CRDTs](https://github.com/abachman/hyperlog-browser).

You can reach me online at adam.bachman@gmail.com or https://twitter.com/abachman.

This account is a scratchpad for personal work and learning. The majority of what you'll find here aren't finished projects, it's more of a rough digital analog of the scratch paper piled around my physical workspace. When I'm working on an idea in my head, I use paper. When I'm working on an idea in software, I use code.

Professionally, I am a software developer for [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/) (USCIS), building applications to support the US Asylum and Refugee programs, [mostly in the interview and remote working space](https://fcw.com/articles/2020/12/03/uscis-tablets-covid-asylum.aspx). Previously, I've worked with [Adafruit Industries](https://github.com/adafruit), [MICA](https://mica.edu), [Figure 53](https://github.com/figure53), [SmartLogic](https://github.com/smartlogic), and an advantage blackjack team you haven't heard of.

Here's a few things you'll find in my repositories: 

- Chrome Extensions: [Timer](https://github.com/abachman/chrome-timer), [My New Tab](https://github.com/abachman/my-new-tab)
- A Ruby library for generating [ULIDs](https://github.com/abachman/ulid-ruby)
- A [small small coding meetup in Baltimore](https://github.com/abachman/goodmorning.computer) (pre-COVID ðŸ˜¢)
- An [anagram generator](https://github.com/abachman/anagrammit-go)
- A pile of teaching materials: [Intermedia Studio - Fall 2018](https://github.com/abachman/intermedia-studio), [Interactive Spaces - Spring 2019](https://github.com/abachman/interactive-spaces) (and [the big project we did](https://github.com/micais2019/interactive-spaces)), [Creative Coding - Fall 2019](https://github.com/abachman/creative-coding-fall-2019), and [Creative Coding - Spring 2020](https://github.com/abachman/creative-coding-spring-2020)
